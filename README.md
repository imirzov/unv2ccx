# Salome to CalculiX converter (unv to inp)

Converts [Salome](https://www.salome-platform.org/) .unv file to [CalculiX](http://dhondt.de/) .inp format.

This converter is based on Joël's Cugnoni UNV parser available with [CalculiX Launcher](http://www.calculixforwin.com/) distribution. I allowed myself to slightely improve it and translate into Python 3. INPWriter's methods are fully refactored and now allow to convert beams. See folder [examples](./examples) for list of tested UNV elements. All generated INP files are processed by CalculiX GraphiX and [CalculiX Adanced Environment](https://github.com/calculix/cae) without any errors.

Thanks to [Niclas Stenberg](https://github.com/Xnst) for fixing bug with empty sets.

<br/><br/>



# How to use

Download Linux and Windows binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/calculix/unv2ccx/releases). Binaries don't need to be installed.

Result INP-file name is the same as UNV-file name. So only one argument should be passed to the converter:

    in Linux:       ./unv2ccx file.unv
    in Windows:     unv2ccx.exe file.unv

<br/><br/>

3D UNV elements converted to INP:

![INP 3D](./Compound_Mesh_3D_inp.png "INP 3D")

# For developers

To run this converter from source you'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install package with command:

    pip3 install unv2ccx

In your code use unv2ccx package in this way:

    import unv2ccx
    c = unv2ccx.Converter(unv_file_name)
    c.run()

If you have Python version >= 3.8 create binary with [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/):

    pip3 install nuitka
    
    In Windows:
    set CC=C:\\MinGW64\\mingw64\\bin\\gcc.exe
    python3 -m nuitka --follow-imports --mingw64 __init__.py

    In Linux:
    python3 -m nuitka --follow-imports __init__.py

If you have Python version < 3.8 create binary with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/):

    pip3 install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller __init__.py --onefile

Read [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) about how to create packages for [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/):

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload dist/*
